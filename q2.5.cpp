/* Translate this table into a programming language of your choice. Then write a
function that takes a list of words (ending "EOI") and runs the list through the
state machine. If the state machine cannot find a transition for a word when in
a given state, return false. If the state machine runs out of words and the
state is not "END" then return false. Otherwise return true.

Then write some unit tests that exercise your function, making sure that it
recognizes valid sentences and rejects invalid ones.

The answer should appear in one or more source files in the same directory as
this file. If I need to do anything more that type a single command to run your
code, include a script or makefile that will do the job. */
